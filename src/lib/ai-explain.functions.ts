Rules:
- The reviewed explanation you are given is correct and is the authority. Never contradict it, and never arrive at a different answer.
- Explain the same reasoning from a different angle: a simpler wording, a small worked example, or the idea behind the step the student most likely missed.
- If the student's choice was wrong, say briefly why that choice is tempting and where it goes wrong.
- Keep it short: at most 120 words, plain text, no headings.
- Write in the language you are asked for. Keep maths notation and the answer choices as they are.`;
